# scago
scago (or **s**ound **c**hange **a**pplier go) is a go library that can apply a sound change ruleset to a word. It's a useful tool in conlanging communities for artificially creating diachronic change in a constructed language.

The library is inspired by KathTheDragon's SCE, a similar tool implemented in Python.

## Construction
This library is still very early in development. Stay tuned!
